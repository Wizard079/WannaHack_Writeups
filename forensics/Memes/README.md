## Writeup

After searching through various web pages and experimenting with multiple tools, I discovered a tool called sigBits for MSB's, which can be easily found [here](https://github.com/Pulho/sigBits).

Using that tool, I obtained the following output:
``` 
> python3 sigBits.py --type=Msb flag.png
Done, check the output file!
```
Upon checking the outputSB.txt, we found that it was a smap mail. Utilizing this 
[tool](https://www.spammimic.com/decode.shtml), we decoded the smap mail and obtained the flag.
