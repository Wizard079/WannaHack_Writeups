## Writeup

By searching the username on GitHub using DuckDuckGo, we found a repository named pr1v4t3. By reading umm.md, we discovered equations:


$\left(\sqrt{1-x^{2}}+\ \sqrt{\left|x\right|}\right)\cdot0.8$  and 
$\left(-\sqrt{1-x^{2}}+\ \sqrt{\left|x\right|}\right)\cdot0.8$


By inputting these equations into Desmos, we generated a heart shape, which is the answer for this challenge.
